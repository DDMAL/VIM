        {% trans ", VIM will build a special website to crowd-source the names of instruments, where pictures of instruments are displayed, and people can submit the name of the instruments in their own language. While this will be a significant undertaking, this should greatly aid in the mapping of instrument names and in searching for the same instrument across sources from different times and places. The multilingual search will be accomplished via a concept similar to a thesaurus, and each instrument will be represented by a URI. This URI will link all the names of the instrument together, and this system will also be used to display the search results in the userâ€™s preferred language when using SESEMMI (Search Engine System for Enhancing Music Metadata Interoperability)." %}
