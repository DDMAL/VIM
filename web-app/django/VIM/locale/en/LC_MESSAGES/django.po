", VIM will build a special website to crowd-source the names of instruments, "
"where pictures of instruments are displayed, and people can submit the name "
"of the instruments in their own language. While this will be a significant "
"undertaking, this should greatly aid in the mapping of instrument names and "
"in searching for the same instrument across sources from different times and "
"places. The multilingual search will be accomplished via a concept similar "
"to a thesaurus, and each instrument will be represented by a URI. This URI "
"will link all the names of the instrument together, and this system will "
"also be used to display the search results in the userâ€™s preferred language "
"when using SESEMMI (Search Engine System for Enhancing Music Metadata "
"Interoperability)."
